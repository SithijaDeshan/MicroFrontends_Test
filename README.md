# Micro-Frontend Project

This project demonstrates a simple micro-frontend architecture using Webpack's Module Federation Plugin. It contains three main components:

- **Products**: Displays a list of product names.
- **Cart**: Shows the number of items in the cart.
- **Container**: Acts as a host for both the Products and Cart components.

The project uses the **Faker** module to generate dummy data and relies on **Webpack** plugins for module federation and HTML management.

## Project Structure

- **Container**: Hosts and integrates the Products and Cart components.
- **Products**: Displays a list of random product names generated by Faker.
- **Cart**: Shows a random number of items in the cart.
